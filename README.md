## Objective

The client has always been a big fan of the original 151 Pok√©mon, and would like to have an app that can serve as their Pok√©dex. They‚Äôd like to browse through the Pokemon, search, manage their favourites, and more.

## Requirements

### Functionality

- [x] Trainers can see a list of Pok√©mon with some general information, such as name, number, picture and types.

- [x] Trainers can search for Pok√©mon by name and number.

- [x] Trainers can see the details of a Pok√©mon, with the general info (name, number, picture, types) but also things like abilities, move set and stats.

- [x] Trainers can see a bigger version of the picture of a Pok√©mon (from the details of one). Include zoom & pan. (for web: we‚Äôre looking for a lightbox component)

- [x] Trainers can mark a Pok√©mon as favourite (or remove it from favourites).

- [x] Trainers have a separate list with only their favourite Pok√©mon.

<details open>
<summary>Nice to have</summary>
<br>

- [x] Besides their favourites, trainers would also like to manage their team of Pok√©mon. A trainer‚Äôs team is limited to 6 Pok√©mon.

- [ ] Quite a few trainers have small devices. The list header (title + search) is quite large, it should collapse when scrolling. [LOW PRIORITY FOR WEB]

- [ ] Trainers would like to see more than one picture for Pok√©mon if available on the detail screen (think carousel like UI).

- [ ] Trainers would like to see the evolutions of a Pok√©mon if available, from the detail screen. Given a details API response, you‚Äôll need to get the species detail first using https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon-species/133, from which you can get the evolution chain using https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/evolution-chain/67.

- [x] Trainers are always on the road in search of new Pok√©mon so they don‚Äôt always have the best connection. The customer would like to have loading and error indicators when data can not be found or it takes long too long.

- [ ] Some trainers have large devices. Your implementation should scale gracefully to larger screens. Even better would be to have a ‚Äúsplit view‚Äù, with the list of Pok√©mon on the left, and the details of one on the right.

- [x] Some trainers are forgetful, and don‚Äôt remember the name or number of a pokemon. Searching by type (such as ‚Äúfire‚Äù) should also be possible.

- [ ] Trainers are used to seeing the stats of a Pok√©mon in the typical hexagon graph.

### Functionality

- [x] Working with a JS Framework such as Vue, Angular, ‚Ä¶

- [x] Usage of a package manager (npm, pnpm‚Ä¶)

- [x] Make use of routing to reflect the currently selected Pok√©mon in the URL.

- [x] Make sure the correct Pok√©mon is displayed when navigating directly to said URL.

- [x] Make the website responsive for different screen sizes (mobile first)

- [x] Make the mobile design a priority

- [x] Make sure the user-specific data (eg: liked Pok√©mon, etc‚Ä¶) persist between browser sessions

- [x] Make use of the essentials of your framework (when applicable) such as :

  - [x] Components

  - [x] Lifecycle hooks

  - [x] Global state management (e.g. Getting Started | Vuex, Pinia üçç)

  - [x] Reactivity

  - [x] Data binding

  - [x] Props / slots

  - [x] Routing

- [x] Use of external libraries when applicable (Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel) (e.g. Axios)

<details open>
<summary>Nice to have</summary>
<br>

- [x] Configure a linter to keep your code clean and consistent

- [x] Use Typescript and consistently type all of your functions and custom objects (**Partly.. was learning it on the go.**)

- [x] Use of utility based css frameworks (e.g. Tailwind CSS - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML., Windi CSS)

- [x] Create a ‚Äò404‚Äô page for navigating to URL‚Äôs that don‚Äôt exist or are invalid

- [x] Use event debouncing/throttling when applicable

- [x] Make sure there is an indicator when loading new data, and make sure no old data is visible when changing selected Pok√©mon
